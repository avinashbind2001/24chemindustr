Self-healing composite is a kind of material with automatic repairing function. The basis of the capsules is that they contain fluids that can fill and seal cracks. Whenever a crack appears, they use the capsules, which are integrated on the surface of the material, to break and fill with liquid. The other is vascular self-repair, which USES the same concept of macro-level capsules through the circulatory system, to aid in continuous healing.
