Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, rapid prototyping or freeform fabrication, is “the process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies” such as machining. Metal powders can vary widely in size, but also in shape (spherical to irregular). As a consequence, processing characteristics in 3D printing metal systems vary, as well.The common specifications of metal powders suitable for 3D printing are the spherical geometry of the particles resulting from the gas atomisation and a particle size distribution according to the layer thickness, usually between 10-50 µm.
