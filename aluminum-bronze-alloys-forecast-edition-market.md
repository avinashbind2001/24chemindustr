The Europe market for Global  Aluminum Bronze Alloys market is estimated to increase from USD million in 2022 to reach USD million by 2030, at a CAGR during the forecast period of 2023 through 2030.

There are some major groups in the Aluminum Bronze family: Aluminum Bronze and Nickel Aluminum Bronze (and also versions that utilize more manganese and silicon). Aluminum Bronze contains approximately 9- 14% aluminum and 4% iron while Nickel Aluminum Bronze contains approximately 9-11% aluminum, 4% iron and 5% nickel. That addition of nickel in the latter further improves the corrosion resistance of a material that is already strong in this area.
