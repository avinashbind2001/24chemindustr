A noble metal catalyst is a type of catalyst that is composed of one or more noble metals, such as platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, or gold. Noble metals are known for their high chemical stability and resistance to corrosion, making them ideal catalysts for various chemical reactions.

These catalysts are widely used in industrial applications, such as the automotive industry for catalytic converters, and in the chemical industry for various chemical reactions. They are also used in fuel cells to facilitate the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy.

Noble metal catalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy, allowing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. They can catalyze a wide range of reactions, including oxidation, reduction, hydrogenation, and dehydrogenation.

One of the benefits of using noble metal catalysts is their high catalytic activity, which allows for efficient conversion of reactants into products. They also exhibit excellent selectivity, meaning they can specifically promote the desired reaction while minimizing the formation of unwanted by-products.

However, noble metal catalysts are often expensive due to the scarcity of noble metals and the complexity of their preparation. Additionally, they may be sensitive to poisoning by various impurities, such as sulfur and carbon monoxide, which can negatively impact their catalytic performance.

To overcome these limitations, researchers are constantly developing novel catalyst designs and exploring alternative catalyst materials with similar catalytic properties but lower cost.
